        <h2 class='stockHeadline'>What is an ETF?</h2>
        <div class='definition'>
            <p>Definition:</p>
            <p>An Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) is a type of investment fund and exchange-traded product, 
                meaning that they are traded on stock exchanges. ETFs hold assets such as stocks, commodities, 
                or bonds, and generally operate with an arbitrage mechanism designed to keep trading close to 
                its net asset value, though deviations can occasionally occur.

            <h2>Understanding ETFs</h2>
            <p class='understandingCompanies'>
                ETFs combine features of mutual funds and individual stocks. They offer diversification benefits 
                like mutual funds and trade like a stock on an exchange. This makes ETFs a versatile tool for 
                investors.
            </p>
            <h2>How ETFs Work</h2>  
            <p>ETFs are created and redeemed by institutional investors. They buy shares of the underlying 
                assets and transfer them to the ETF provider in exchange for ETF shares. Investors can then 
                buy these shares on the open market.
