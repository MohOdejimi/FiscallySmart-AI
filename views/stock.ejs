        <div class = 'definition'>
            <p>Definition: </p>
            <p>A stock is essentially a tiny piece of ownership in a company. 
                When a company decides to raise money by selling pieces of itself, 
                those pieces are called stocks or shares. 
                People who buy stocks are called shareholders. Stocks provide a route for 
                people of different economic backgrounds to invest, potentially accumlating returns 
                and growing their wealth if the perfomance metrics of the company 
                improves.

            <h2>Understanding Compaines and Stocks</h2>
            <p class = 'understandingCompanies'>Companies can be categorized into two based on accessibility to investors: 
                public and pivate. Public companies raise capital by selling shares to the public, 
                allowing anyone to invest. They are more heavily regulated and have stricter requirements.
                Examples: Apple, Alphabet, Tesla. 
                Private companies raise capital from a select group of 
                investors and their shares are not traded on public exchanges. 
                Funding may come from founders, venture capitalists, or bank loans. 
                They have more flexibility but less access to capital. Examples: Many startups, LLCs.</p>
            <h2>The Concept of Shares and Ownership in a Company</h2>  
            <p>Shares are units of ownership interest in a company. 
                When a company issues shares, it is essentially selling a portion 
                of itself to raise capital for its expenses. Each share issuesd by the company represents 
                a fraction of the companyâ€™s equity 
                and entitles the holder to certain rights and privileges.</p>
            <p>Shares can be grouped into two divisions based on the rights and claims that are ascribed 
                to its holders.

                <ul>
                    <li>Provide voting rights to shareholders.</li>

                <li>Preferred Shares: </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Typically do not provide voting rights.</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
          <div class = 'ownership'>
            <p>Ownership Structure: </p>
            <p>
                Ownership in a company is determined by the number of shares held by an individual or entity. 
                For example, if a company has issued 1,000 shares and you own 100 of them, you own 10% of the company.
