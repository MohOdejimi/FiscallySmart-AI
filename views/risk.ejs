        <div class = 'definition'>
            <p>Definition: </p>
            <p>Risk and return are fundamental concepts in investing. Risk refers to the potential for loss or variability in investment returns, while return refers to the gain or loss generated by an investment over a specific period. Different asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and real estate, come with varying levels of risk and potential returns.</p>

            <h2>Understanding Asset Classes</h2>
            <p class = 'understandingCompanies'>Asset classes are categories of investments with similar characteristics and behavior in the marketplace. Here are some common asset classes and their typical risk and return profiles:</p>
            <h2 id = 'risk'>Stocks</h2>  
            <p>Stocks represent ownership in a company and are known for their potential for high returns. However, they also come with higher risk, as stock prices can be volatile and influenced by various factors such as company performance, market conditions, and economic events.</p>
            <ol id ='list'>
                <li>Risk:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>High volatility and potential for significant loss.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Return: </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Potential for high returns over the long term.</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
            <h2>Bonds</h2>  
            <p>Bonds are debt securities issued by corporations, municipalities, or governments. They tend to be less risky than stocks but generally offer lower returns. Bonds provide regular interest payments and return the principal at maturity.</p>
            <ol id ='list'>
                <li>Risk:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lower risk compared to stocks but can be affected by interest rates and issuer creditworthiness.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Return: </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Steady income through interest payments and principal repayment at maturity.</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
            <h2>Real Estate</h2>  
            <p>Real estate investments involve purchasing property to generate income or appreciation. Real estate can provide a steady income stream through rent and potential capital gains from property value appreciation.</p>
            <ol id ='list'>
                <li>Risk:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Moderate risk, affected by market conditions, property location, and economic factors.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Return: </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Potential for steady rental income and long-term appreciation.</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
            <h2>Commodities</h2>  
            <p>Commodities include physical assets like gold, oil, and agricultural products. They can provide diversification and act as a hedge against inflation, but they can also be highly volatile.</p>
            <ol id ='list'>
                <li>Risk:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>High volatility due to supply and demand factors, geopolitical events, and market speculation.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Return: </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Potential for significant returns but also substantial risk of loss.</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div class = 'typesofStocks'>
            <h2>Balancing Risk and Return</h2>
            <p>Investors can balance risk and return by diversifying their portfolios across different asset classes. Diversification reduces the impact of poor performance in any single investment and can help achieve more stable returns over time.</p>
            <ol id ='list'>
                <li>Diversification:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Spreading investments across various asset classes to reduce risk.</li>
                    <li>Helps achieve a balance between risk and return.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Asset Allocation: </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Determining the right mix of asset classes based on individual risk tolerance, investment goals, and time horizon.</li>
                    <li>Adjusting the allocation over time as goals and market conditions change.</li>
                </ul>
            </ol>
        </div>
        <div class = 'takeaway'>
            <h2>Takeaway</h2>
            <p>Understanding the risk and return characteristics of different asset classes is crucial for making informed investment decisions. By diversifying your investments and balancing your portfolio, you can manage risk and aim for consistent returns that align with your financial goals.</p>
