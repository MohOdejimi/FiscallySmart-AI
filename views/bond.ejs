            <p>Definition: </p>
            <p>
                A bond is a type of debt instrument issued by corporations, 
                municipalities, states, and sovereign governments to raise capital. 
                When you purchase a bond, you are essentially lending money to the issuer in exchange for
                 periodic interest payments and the return of the bond's face value, or principal, 
                 when it matures.    
            </p>

            <h2>Understanding Bonds as Debt Instruments</h2>
            <p class= 'understandingCompanies'>Bonds serve as debt instruments by providing a mechanism 
                for entities such as governments, corporations, and municipalities to borrow money from 
                investors. When an entity issues a bond, it is essentially taking out a loan from 
                bondholders, who in turn become creditors. 
            </p>
            <h2>Issuers of bonds</h2>  
            <p>Issuers of bonds include a diverse array of entities such as governments, 
                corporations, municipalities, and other organizations seeking to raise capital. </p>
            <p>Bonds can be categorized into two primary classes based on the level of security 
                and repayment rights granted to the investor. These categories reflect the varying 
                degrees of risk and potential return associated with each type of bond.

            <p>
                Bonds are considered a safer investment compared to stocks because they provide
                 regular interest payments and return the principal at maturity, assuming the issuer 
                 does not default. However, they typically offer lower returns compared to stocks.
                  Bonds are also used to diversify investment portfolios and can act as a hedge against 
                  the volatility of the stock market.
